/** 36.) Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. 

Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.

Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 
Example 1:

Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]] 

Output: false

Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. 
Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid. **/
